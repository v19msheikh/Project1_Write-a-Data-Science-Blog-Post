## 3. The rate of increase in salary with the years of experience

With no surprise, the pattern is linear over the number of years of experience. Those very new to the tech industry, with less than a year of experience, can expect to get a normal pay of $24,673 (a year-over-year increment of 12.16 percent). Following a year or two, that normal pay hops to $33,953 (a whopping 37.6 percent expansion, year-over-year).

## 4. More Languages = More Money?

It doesn't make much difference at all. A developer specialized in one programming language get a normal pay of $53,202 whereas the one who is skilled in 9 different languages get a normal compensation of $53,301 (0.18% more).
