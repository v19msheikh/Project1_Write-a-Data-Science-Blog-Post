With no surprise, the pattern is linear over the number of years of experience. Those very new to the tech industry, with less than a year of experience, can expect to get a normal pay of $24,673 (a year-over-year increment of 12.16 percent). Following a year or two, that normal pay hops to $33,953 (a whopping 37.6 percent expansion, year-over-year).

## 4. More Languages = More Money?
